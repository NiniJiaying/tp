## 1. About BookCoin
BookCoin (to the Moon) is a **desktop app for managing bookings that presents users with a structured and detailed information on facility availability via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). BookCoin is designed for administrative personnels of schools or organisations who need to manage bookings across a large number of facilities. If you can type fast, BookCoin can get your facility management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Enjoy!


## 2. Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `bookingapp.jar` [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-3/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder that you want to use as the _home folder_ for BookCoin.

1. Run `java -jar bookingapp.jar via your terminal` (preferred). As a second alternative, double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. <br>

   ![Ui](images/Ui_Booking_1.3.png) <br><br>
   Note how the app contains some sample data. This is for you to test out the commands first, and you may delete them using the `clear` command when you are ready to use the app for your own purposes. <br>


1. Type the command in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list_venue`** : Lists all venues.

   * **`add_venue v/Chua Thian Poh Hall`** : Starts a multi-step command to create a venue named `Chua Thian Poh Hall`. Fill in the prompts as directed.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#3-features) below for details of each command.

**:information_source: Using BookCoin:**<br>

This section gives an overview of BookCoinâ€™s layout so that you can get started quickly.

**There are four main segments in BookCoin:**
* Tabs that allow you to navigate between Persons, Venues and Bookings

* A command box as well as a result display box at the top left of the application

* A bookmark list on the left of the screen

* A main viewing area that would display complete information about a person, venue or booking

</div>

## 3. Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `find_venue v/VENUE_NAME`, `VENUE_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `find_venue v/Victoria Hall`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `add_venue v/VENUE_NAME [max/MAXIMUM_OCCUPANCY]` can be used as `v/Chua Thian Poh Hall max/40` or as `v/Chua Thian Poh Hall`.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `exit 123`, it will be interpreted as `exit`. 

</div>

### 3.1. General features and commands

#### 3.1.1. Viewing all available commands : `help`

Displays the link to the user guide.

Format: `help`

#### 3.1.2. Deletes all records : `clear`

Deletes all records in the booking system.

Format: `clear`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Warning about clear command:**<br>

* The clear command is especially useful for first time users because the app would first launch with sample data for new users
  to have greater convenience when testing app functionalities. Users can then use the clear command to
  clear the database of sample data after familiarising themselves with the app.

* To prevent indiscriminate or accidental use of the clear command which could be potentially disastrous, we have included an
  inbuilt confirmation message that users would need to affirm.

</div>

#### 3.1.3. Saving the data

BookCoin data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command which results in changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

#### 3.1.4. Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### 3.2. Commands specific to multi-step commands

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: More information about multi-step commands:**<br>

* Some commands require multiple input information which can be very tedious to type in one go. 
Multi-step commands therefore allow such commands to be used with greater ease by users as the system will prompt them for input items one at a time. To skip input for optional fields, you can just press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key without typing anything when you are prompted to enter an optional field.
* The commands listed in this section are specific to multi-step commands and are only applicable when the user is in the middle of a multi-step command.

</div>

#### 3.2.2. Exiting prompting : `exit_prompt`

Format: `exit_prompt`

### 3.3. Person

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: About persons:**<br>

* BookCoin stores information about venue bookers which is important for scheduling/ contacting purposes. When bookers are stored, their information can be used for multiple bookings in the future which allows you to access their details easily without having to repeat the same booker details multiple times across bookings.
* For your convenience, we use the term "person" in the app instead of "booker" to make a distinction between "booker" and "booking", which can be confusing.
* Persons are identified by their emails, hence all email inputs between persons must be unique. Persons with the same name are allowed.
