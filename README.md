# BookCoin

**BookCoin (To The Moon)** is a CLI facility management system which allows users to manage bookings and presents users a structured and detailed information on facility availability. If you can type fast, BookCoin can get your facility management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps!

  <br>
Our targeted users are administrative personnels of schools or organisations who need to manage bookings and usage of a large number of facilities. They have to ensure that bookings and usages of facilities abide by restrictions in addition to checking that the bookings are valid.
